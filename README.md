This driver extends Adonis Ally and allows to integrate Apple Sign In.

## Installation

```bash

# or
yarn add @bitkidd/adonis-ally-apple
```

As the package has been installed, you have to configure it by running a command:

```bash
node ace configure @bitkidd/adonis-ally-apple

And don't forget to add these variables to your `.env` and `.env.sample` files.
